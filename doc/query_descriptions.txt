Query 1: Patient Registration:
	Takes input of a first and last name from the user and inserts. First, a query is used to see whether
	a patient with the same name already exists with a select statement matching the first and last names.
	This is done because unique first and last names are required for login. If there is no previously
	existing patient with the same name, a new tuple is inserted into the relation.

Query 2: Appointment scheduling
	Takes input of a time and date from the user and uses a hidden form field to pass the patID to the query.
	The query first checks if the patient already has an appointment at that time and date using a 
	select statement with each of the conditions. If there is no appointment scheduled, then a new
	tuple is inserted into the appointment relation.

Query 3: Submitting Service Event
	Takes input of a procedure and the employee who performed it and inserts a new tuple into the 
	ServiceLog relation. Triggers in the DBMS then update the balance of the patient in the patient relation.

Query 4: Appointment Cancellation
	Takes input of a time and date in the same format as insertion from the user. A query using a select
	statement is used to check that a matchin appointment has been scheduled. If so, the matching tuple
	is then deleted from the appointment relation.

Query 5: View Current Appointments/Transaction history
	These queries return the all of the scheduled appointments of the current user or their complete 
	transaction history. They are both select statements on the appoint/transaction relation which
	select all tuples that have a matching patient ID.
