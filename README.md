# InteractiveDatabaseWebapp

This is a web application made for my CSC 460 Database class at the University of Arizona and was made in collaboration with another student.

Unfortunately, due to using the Oracle SQL database at the university this program will not be able to issue queries and return data.
I plan to add this functionality back in using an MS-SQL database sometime in the future.

The web application uses html and jsp pages hosted on a tomcat server to allow users to access different features one might find on a 
dentist office's website. Users can create credentials, log into their profile, book appointments, and make payments.
